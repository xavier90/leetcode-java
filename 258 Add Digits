Given a non-negative integer num, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit.

For example:

Given num = 38, the process is like: 3 + 8 = 11, 1 + 1 = 2. Since 2 has only one digit, return it.

public class solution {
    public int addDigits(int num) {
        if(num%9 == 0 && n != 0) {
            return 9;
        } else {
            return num%9;
        }
    }
}
